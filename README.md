## Overview

ChainSignal is SaaS platform designed to democratize institutional-grade insights with a unique user-centric approach.

## ChainSignal’s Differentiation Strategy

A. Core Innovations

Predictive Behavior Engine 

Uses AI to flag emerging trends (e.g., whale accumulation, miner capitulation) 12–48 hours before market shifts, similar to Merkle Science’s threat detection.
Integrates metrics like Miner Profit/Loss and Exchange Reserve Alerts.

Contextual Intelligence Layer

Overlays on-chain data with real-world events (e.g., ETF flows, regulatory news).
Visualizes correlations (e.g., "Fed rate hikes → BTC outflows").

Workflow Automation
No-code alert builders (e.g., "Notify me if >1,000 BTC moves to exchanges").
Zapier-style integrations with exchanges/TradingView 10.

B. User Experience Edge

Adaptive Dashboards: Beginners see pre-built templates (e.g., "Bull Market Signals"); pros access raw data.
WalletDNA™: Clusters wallets by behavior (e.g., "Long-term holders," "OTC services") using Allium’s Wallet360™ principles

## Core System Workflows

Real-time Alert Pipeline:
- Client sends metric subscription via WebSocket
- Next.js middleware processes incoming blocks
- Checks against user alert conditions in Neon DB
- Triggers notifications via serverless functions
- Updates UI via React context
